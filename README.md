# Multi-Agent Large Language Models: Group Dynamics and Complex Task Solving

## Overview

This repository hosts the research paper and supplementary materials for our study on the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems. The focus is on analyzing how LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo-16K and GPT-4-1106 can mimic group dynamics and efficiently solve complex tasks within organizational contexts.

## Paper Abstract

The paper investigates the utilization of LLMs in multi-agent settings to simulate human-like group behaviors in complex problem-solving. We conducted two main experiments:

1. Analysis of stock trends of MAANG companies using visual and tabular data summaries.
2. Summarization of recent scholarly articles on LLMs from the arXiv catalog.

Our findings demonstrate the LLMs' capability to perform collaborative tasks effectively, akin to human teams, addressing both the potential and limitations of these technologies in organizational setups. The study also explores the implications of cost and the prospects for deploying cost-effective, task-specific LLMs in real-world applications.
