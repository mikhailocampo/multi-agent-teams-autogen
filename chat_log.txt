    find up to 5 papers on large language model applications from arxiv, create a summary and insights about the trends.
    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Planner (to chat_manager):

**Initial Plan:**

1. **Engineer**: Write a script to query the arXiv API for recent papers on large language model applications. The script should filter for the most relevant and recent papers, up to a maximum of five. The engineer will ensure that the script can parse the metadata to retrieve the paper titles, authors, abstracts, and submission dates.

2. **Scientist**: Manually review the papers retrieved by the engineer's script to ensure they are indeed relevant to the topic of large language model applications. The scientist will read the full text of the papers if necessary to confirm their relevance.

3. **Engineer**: Develop a text summarization algorithm or use an existing one to create concise summaries of the selected papers. The summaries should capture the key points, methodologies, and findings of each paper.

4. **Scientist**: Analyze the summaries and the full text of the papers to provide insights and identify trends in the field of large language model applications. The scientist will look for common themes, novel approaches, and any gaps in the research that are evident from the papers.

5. **Engineer and Scientist**: Collaborate to compile the summaries and insights into a coherent report. The engineer will focus on the technical aspects of the presentation, such as formatting and data visualization, while the scientist will ensure the content accurately reflects the current research landscape.

6. **Engineer**: If necessary, revise the script based on feedback from the scientist to better tailor the search criteria for future queries.

7. **Scientist**: If necessary, revise the insights and trends analysis based on feedback from the admin to ensure the report meets the desired objectives and quality standards.

8. **Admin**: Review the report and provide feedback to the engineer and scientist. The admin will ensure that the report is comprehensive, accurate, and aligns with the intended purpose.

9. **Engineer and Scientist**: Implement any revisions suggested by the admin and finalize the report.

10. **Admin**: Approve the final report for dissemination or use.

**Feedback Loop:**

- After each step involving content creation (steps 3, 4, and 5), the admin will review the output and provide feedback.
- The engineer and scientist will revise their work based on the admin's feedback until the admin approves the content.

Would you like to proceed with this plan, or are there any modifications you would like to suggest before we begin?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Critic (to chat_manager):

The plan outlined is comprehensive and well-structured, covering the necessary steps to retrieve, summarize, and analyze papers on large language model applications from arXiv. However, there are a few points that could be improved or clarified:

1. **Verification of Sources**: The plan does not explicitly mention how the script will verify the credibility and relevance of the papers. It's important to ensure that the papers are peer-reviewed or come from reputable authors or institutions.

2. **Summarization Method**: The plan mentions developing or using an existing text summarization algorithm but does not specify which method will be used. It would be beneficial to clarify whether an extractive or abstractive summarization approach will be taken, or if a combination of both will be used.

3. **Trend Analysis**: While the plan includes analyzing the summaries for trends, it could be more specific about the types of trends to look for. For example, trends could include the evolution of model architectures, novel application domains, performance improvements, ethical considerations, or shifts in dataset usage.

4. **Inclusion of Source URLs**: The plan should explicitly state that the final report will include the URLs or DOIs of the arXiv papers to allow for easy verification and further reading.

5. **Timeline and Milestones**: The plan does not mention a timeline or set milestones for each step. Including a timeline would help manage expectations and ensure that the project stays on track.

6. **Feedback Mechanism**: While the plan includes a feedback loop, it could detail the specific criteria the admin will use to evaluate the summaries and insights. This would help the engineer and scientist understand the standards they need to meet.

7. **Contingency Plans**: The plan could benefit from including contingency measures in case the initial script does not return relevant results or if the summarization algorithm does not perform adequately.

8. **Ethical Considerations**: The plan should consider the ethical implications of using large language models and ensure that the report addresses these concerns, especially in light of recent discussions around the impact of AI on society.

9. **Public Accessibility**: The plan should mention how the final report will be made accessible to the public, whether it will be published online, and if there are any copyright or distribution considerations.

10. **Limitations and Future Work**: The report should include a section on the limitations of the current research and potential areas for future work. This would provide context and direction for readers interested in the field.

Overall, the plan is on the right track, but incorporating these suggestions would enhance its thoroughness and effectiveness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Planner (to chat_manager):

**Revised Plan with Critic's Feedback Incorporated:**

1. **Engineer**: Modify the script to include a verification step that checks the credibility of the papers by looking for indicators such as peer-review status, citations, and author/institution reputation. The script will also ensure that only papers relevant to large language model applications are retrieved.

2. **Scientist**: In addition to manual review, the scientist will cross-reference the papers with other databases or citation indices to confirm their impact and relevance in the field.

3. **Engineer**: Specify the summarization method to be used, opting for a hybrid approach that combines extractive and abstractive summarization techniques to ensure high-quality summaries. The engineer will also test the summarization algorithm for accuracy and coherence.

4. **Scientist**: Conduct a more detailed trend analysis, looking for specific patterns such as advancements in model architectures, emerging application areas, performance benchmarks, ethical discussions, and dataset innovations.

5. **Engineer and Scientist**: Ensure that the final report includes the URLs or DOIs for each paper, providing direct access to the original sources.

6. **Admin**: Establish a timeline with milestones for each step of the project, including deadlines for the initial script, summarization, trend analysis, and report compilation. The admin will communicate these milestones to the engineer and scientist.

7. **Admin**: Define clear evaluation criteria for the summaries and insights, such as accuracy, comprehensiveness, clarity, and the inclusion of critical analysis.

8. **Engineer and Scientist**: Develop contingency plans, such as alternative search strategies or summarization techniques, in case the initial approaches do not yield satisfactory results.

9. **Scientist**: Address ethical considerations in the report, discussing the potential societal impacts of large language models and highlighting responsible research practices.

10. **Engineer and Scientist**: Plan for the public accessibility of the final report, considering online publication, copyright issues, and ensuring that the report is written in a manner accessible to a broad audience.

11. **Scientist**: Include a section in the report on the limitations of the current research and suggest areas for future work, providing a comprehensive view of the field's trajectory.

12. **Admin**: Review the revised plan and provide final approval before the engineer and scientist proceed with the execution.

**Feedback Loop:**

- The admin will review each milestone deliverable and provide feedback based on the established criteria.
- The engineer and scientist will revise their work according to the admin's feedback and resubmit for approval.
- This process will continue until the admin is satisfied with the results at each milestone.

Admin, does this revised plan address your concerns, and can we proceed with the project?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
Admin (to chat_manager):

As the admin, I find the revised plan to be thorough and well-considered, incorporating the necessary adjustments to ensure the project's success. The inclusion of verification steps, a specified summarization method, detailed trend analysis, and clear evaluation criteria will contribute to the production of a high-quality report. The consideration of ethical implications and public accessibility is also commendable.

Before proceeding, I would like to confirm the following:

- The timeline is realistic and allows for adequate time for each step, including the feedback and revision cycles.
- The contingency plans are feasible and will not significantly delay the project if implemented.
- The final report will be accessible not only to experts but also to non-specialist audiences, ensuring broad understanding and impact.

Once these points are confirmed, you have my approval to begin the project. Please keep me updated on the progress according to the established milestones, and I look forward to reviewing the deliverables at each stage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer (to chat_manager):

As the engineer, I will now proceed with the first step of the revised plan, which is to write a Python script to query the arXiv API for recent papers on large language model applications. The script will filter for the most relevant and recent papers, up to a maximum of five, and retrieve their titles, authors, abstracts, and submission dates. I will also include a verification step to check the credibility of the papers.

Let's begin by writing the script to query the arXiv API:

```python
import requests
import feedparser

# Define the base URL for the arXiv API
ARXIV_API_URL = "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?"

# Define the search query parameters
search_query = 'cat:cs.CL AND ti:"large language model"'
start = 0
max_results = 5
sort_by = "submittedDate"
sort_order = "descending"

# Construct the query URL
query = f"search_query={search_query}&start={start}&max_results={max_results}&sortBy={sort_by}&sortOrder={sort_order}"

# Send the GET request to the arXiv API
response = requests.get(ARXIV_API_URL + query)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the response using feedparser
    feed = feedparser.parse(response.content)
    
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the paper information
    papers = []
    
    # Loop through each entry and extract relevant information
    for entry in feed.entries:
        paper_info = {
            'title': entry.title,
            'authors': [author.name for author in entry.authors],
            'abstract': entry.summary,
            'submission_date': entry.published,
            'arxiv_id': entry.id.split('/abs/')[-1]
        }
        papers.append(paper_info)
    
    # Output the retrieved papers
    for paper in papers:
        print(f"Title: {paper['title']}")
        print(f"Authors: {', '.join(paper['authors'])}")
        print(f"Abstract: {paper['abstract']}")
        print(f"Submission Date: {paper['submission_date']}")
        print(f"arXiv ID: {paper['arxiv_id']}")
        print("-" * 80)
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve papers. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

This script will retrieve up to five recent papers on large language model applications from the arXiv API, including their titles, authors, abstracts, and submission dates. After executing this script, I will review the output to ensure that the papers are relevant and credible.

Engineer (to chat_manager):

It appears that the `requests` module is not installed in the current environment. To resolve this issue, I will modify the script to use the built-in `urllib` library instead of `requests` for making the HTTP request to the arXiv API. Here is the updated script:

```python
import urllib.request

        papers = []
        
        # Loop through each entry and extract relevant information
        for entry in feed.entries:
            paper_info = {
                'title': entry.title,
                'authors': [author.name for author in entry.authors],
                'abstract': entry.summary,
                'submission_date': entry.published,
                'arxiv_id': entry.id.split('/abs/')[-1]
            }
            papers.append(paper_info)
        
        # Output the retrieved papers
        for paper in papers:
            print(f"Title: {paper['title']}")
            print(f"Authors: {', '.join(paper['authors'])}")
            print(f"Abstract: {paper['abstract']}")
            print(f"Submission Date: {paper['submission_date']}")
            print(f"arXiv ID: {paper['arxiv_id']}")
            print("-" * 80)
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve papers. Status code: {response.status}")
```

This script should now work in the current environment. Let's execute it to retrieve the papers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer (to chat_manager):

It seems that the `feedparser` module is also not available in the current environment. I will now rewrite the script to avoid using external libraries that are not installed. Instead, I will use built-in Python libraries such as `urllib` for the HTTP request and `xml.etree.ElementTree` to parse the XML response from the arXiv API.

Here is the updated script:

```python
import urllib.request
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# Define the base URL for the arXiv API
ARXIV_API_URL = "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?"

# Define the search query parameters
search_query = 'cat:cs.CL AND ti:"large language model"'

        ns = {'arxiv': 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'}
        
        # Initialize an empty list to hold the paper information
        papers = []
        
        # Loop through each entry and extract relevant information
        for entry in root.findall('arxiv:entry', ns):
            paper_info = {
                'title': entry.find('arxiv:title', ns).text,
                'authors': [author.find('arxiv:name', ns).text for author in entry.findall('arxiv:author', ns)],
                'abstract': entry.find('arxiv:summary', ns).text.strip(),
                'submission_date': entry.find('arxiv:published', ns).text,
                'arxiv_id': entry.find('arxiv:id', ns).text.split('/abs/')[-1]
            }
            papers.append(paper_info)
        
        # Output the retrieved papers
        for paper in papers:

            print("-" * 80)
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve papers. Status code: {response.status}")
```

This script should now work without any external dependencies. Let's execute it to retrieve the papers.

The error indicates that the URL contains control characters (spaces), which are not valid in a URL. To fix this, I will encode the query parameters to ensure that the URL is correctly formatted. Here is the updated script:

```python

    'max_results': max_results,
    'sortBy': sort_by,
    'sortOrder': sort_order
}
query = urllib.parse.urlencode(params)

# Send the GET request to the arXiv API
with urllib.request.urlopen(ARXIV_API_URL + query) as response:
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status == 200:
        # Parse the response using ElementTree

            print(f"arXiv ID: {paper['arxiv_id']}")
            print("-" * 80)
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve papers. Status code: {response.status}")
```

This script now uses `urllib.parse.urlencode` to encode the query parameters, which should prevent the `InvalidURL` error. Let's execute the script to retrieve the papers.

Title: Large Language Model Agent as a Mechanical Designer
Authors: Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani
Abstract: Conventional mechanical design paradigms rely on experts systematically
refining concepts through experience-guided modification and FEA to meet
specific requirements. However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavily
dependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learning
models have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driven
iterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data and
considerable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deep
learning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for which
they were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. This
creates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand for
resources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integrates
pre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design and
provides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan,
generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing the
iterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reason
about and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Our
results reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate truss
designs that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate of
up to 90%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employing
prompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibit
optimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iteratively
refine designs to meet specifications. This ability of LLM agents to produce
viable designs and optimize them based on their inherent reasoning capabilities
highlights their potential to develop and implement effective design strategies
autonomously.

Title: On the Use of Large Language Models to Generate Capability Ontologies
Authors: Luis Miguel Vieira da Silva, Aljosha Köcher, Felix Gehlhoff, Alexander Fay
Abstract: Capability ontologies are increasingly used to model functionalities of
systems or machines. The creation of such ontological models with all
properties and constraints of capabilities is very complex and can only be done
by ontology experts. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that they
can generate machine-interpretable models from natural language text input and
thus support engineers / ontology experts. Therefore, this paper investigates
how LLMs can be used to create capability ontologies. We present a study with a
series of experiments in which capabilities with varying complexities are
generated using different prompting techniques and with different LLMs. Errors
in the generated ontologies are recorded and compared. To analyze the quality
of the generated ontologies, a semi-automated approach based on RDF syntax
checking, OWL reasoning, and SHACL constraints is used. The results of this
study are very promising because even for complex capabilities, the generated
ontologies are almost free of errors.

Title: A Comprehensive Evaluation on Event Reasoning of Large Language Models
Authors: Zhengwei Tao, Zhi Jin, Yifan Zhang, Xiancai Chen, Xiaoying Bai, Yue Fang, Haiyan Zhao, Jia Li, Chongyang Tao
Abstract: Event reasoning is a fundamental ability that underlies many applications. It
requires event schema knowledge to perform global reasoning and needs to deal
with the diversity of the inter-event relations and the reasoning paradigms.
How well LLMs accomplish event reasoning on various relations and reasoning
paradigms remains unknown. To mitigate this disparity, we comprehensively
evaluate the abilities of event reasoning of LLMs. We introduce a novel
benchmark EV2 for EValuation of EVent reasoning. EV2 consists of two levels of
evaluation of schema and instance and is comprehensive in relations and
reasoning paradigms. We conduct extensive experiments on EV2. We find that LLMs
have abilities to accomplish event reasoning but their performances are far
from satisfactory. We also notice the imbalance of event reasoning abilities in
LLMs. Besides, LLMs have event schema knowledge, however, they're not aligned
with humans on how to utilize the knowledge. Based on these findings, we
introduce two methods to guide the LLMs to utilize the event schema knowledge.
Both methods achieve improvements.

Title: Ruffle&Riley: Insights from Designing and Evaluating a Large Language
  Model-Based Conversational Tutoring System
Authors: Robin Schmucker, Meng Xia, Amos Azaria, Tom Mitchell
Abstract: Conversational tutoring systems (CTSs) offer learning experiences through
interactions based on natural language. They are recognized for promoting
cognitive engagement and improving learning outcomes, especially in reasoning
tasks. Nonetheless, the cost associated with authoring CTS content is a major
obstacle to widespread adoption and to research on effective instructional
design. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate a novel type of CTS that
leverages recent advances in large language models (LLMs) in two ways: First,
the system enables AI-assisted content authoring by inducing an easily editable
tutoring script automatically from a lesson text. Second, the system automates
the script orchestration in a learning-by-teaching format via two LLM-based
agents (Ruffle&Riley) acting as a student and a professor. The system allows
for free-form conversations that follow the ITS-typical inner and outer loop
structure. We evaluate Ruffle&Riley's ability to support biology lessons in two
between-subject online user studies (N = 200) comparing the system to simpler
QA chatbots and reading activity. Analyzing system usage patterns,
pre/post-test scores and user experience surveys, we find that Ruffle&Riley
users report high levels of engagement, understanding and perceive the offered
support as helpful. Even though Ruffle&Riley users require more time to
complete the activity, we did not find significant differences in short-term

Title: Automated Data Visualization from Natural Language via Large Language
  Models: An Exploratory Study
Authors: Yang Wu, Yao Wan, Hongyu Zhang, Yulei Sui, Wucai Wei, Wei Zhao, Guandong Xu, Hai Jin
Abstract: The Natural Language to Visualization (NL2Vis) task aims to transform
natural-language descriptions into visual representations for a grounded table,
enabling users to gain insights from vast amounts of data. Recently, many deep
learning-based approaches have been developed for NL2Vis. Despite the
considerable efforts made by these approaches, challenges persist in
visualizing data sourced from unseen databases or spanning multiple tables.
Taking inspiration from the remarkable generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), this paper conducts an empirical study to evaluate
their potential in generating visualizations, and explore the effectiveness of
in-context learning prompts for enhancing this task. In particular, we first
explore the ways of transforming structured tabular data into sequential text
prompts, as to feed them into LLMs and analyze which table content contributes
most to the NL2Vis. Our findings suggest that transforming structured tabular
data into programs is effective, and it is essential to consider the table
schema when formulating prompts. Furthermore, we evaluate two types of LLMs:
finetuned models (e.g., T5-Small) and inference-only models (e.g., GPT-3.5),
against state-of-the-art methods, using the NL2Vis benchmarks (i.e., nvBench).
The experimental results reveal that LLMs outperform baselines, with
inference-only models consistently exhibiting performance improvements, at
times even surpassing fine-tuned models when provided with certain few-shot
demonstrations through in-context learning. Finally, we analyze when the LLMs
fail in NL2Vis, and propose to iteratively update the results using strategies
such as chain-of-thought, role-playing, and code-interpreter. The experimental
results confirm the efficacy of iterative updates and hold great potential for
future study.
