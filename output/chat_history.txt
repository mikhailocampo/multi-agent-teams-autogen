Engineer (to Admin):

I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that there was an error in executing the code due to an unexpected keyword argument in the `get_data_yahoo` function.

To resolve this issue, we can use an alternative approach to fetch the historical stock data using the `yfinance` library. Please make sure you have the `yfinance` and `matplotlib` libraries installed before running the code. You can install them by running the following commands:

```shell
pip install yfinance matplotlib
```

Once the installation is complete, please execute the following code:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the list of MAANG companies
companies = ['META', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'NFLX', 'GOOGL']

# Fetch the historical stock data for the last 3 months
data = yf.download(companies, period='3mo', group_by='ticker')['Close']

# Plot the stock prices
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for company in companies:
    plt.plot(data.index, data[company], label=company)
plt.title('Stock Prices Comparison')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()

# Save the visual comparison as a PNG file
plt.savefig('stock_prices_comparison.png')

# Print the table of stock prices
print(data)

# Calculate the stock trends summary
summary = {}
for company in companies:
    last_price = data[company][-1]
    first_price = data[company][0]
    change = (last_price - first_price) / first_price * 100
    summary[company] = change

# Print the stock trends summary
print('\nStock Trends Summary:')
for company, change in summary.items():
    print(f'{company}: {change:.2f}%')
```

Engineer (to Admin):
After running the code, it will generate a PNG file named `stock_prices_comparison.png` which contains the visual comparison of the stock prices. It will also print a table of the stock prices for the last 3 months and provide a summary of the stock trends for each company.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!

Engineer (to Admin):

I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that there was an error in executing the code due to a KeyError when trying to access the 'Close' column of the fetched data.

To resolve this issue, let's modify the code to fetch the historical stock data using the `yfinance` library and then access the 'Close' column separately. Please execute the following code:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Define the list of MAANG companies
companies = ['META', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'NFLX', 'GOOGL']

# Fetch the historical stock data for the last 3 months
data = yf.download(companies, period='3mo', group_by='ticker')

# Extract the 'Close' column from the fetched data
close_data = data['Close']

# Plot the stock prices
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for company in companies:
    plt.plot(close_data.index, close_data[company], label=company)
plt.title('Stock Prices Comparison')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()

# Save the visual comparison as a PNG file
plt.savefig('stock_prices_comparison.png')

# Print the table of stock prices
print(close_data)

# Calculate the stock trends summary
summary = {}
for company in companies:
    last_price = close_data[company][-1]
    first_price = close_data[company][0]
    change = (last_price - first_price) / first_price * 100
    summary[company] = change

# Print the stock trends summary
print('\nStock Trends Summary:')
for company, change in summary.items():
    print(f'{company}: {change:.2f}%')
```

After running the code, it will generate a PNG file named `stock_prices_comparison.png` which contains the visual comparison of the stock prices. It will also print a table of the stock prices for the last 3 months and provide a summary of the stock trends for each company.

Using the stock trends, write a TXT file to provide a summary of all of the stocks. Include a table within the text file of the stocks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer (to Admin):

Certainly! To write a summary of the stock trends and include a table within a text file, you can use the following code:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the list of MAANG companies
companies = ['META', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'NFLX', 'GOOGL']

# Fetch the historical stock data for the last 3 months
data = yf.download(companies, period='3mo', group_by='ticker')

# Create a table of the stock prices for the last 3 months
table = pd.DataFrame()
for company in companies:
    table[company] = data[company]['Close']
table.columns = [company + ' Stock Price' for company in companies]
table.index.name = 'Date'

# Calculate the stock trends summary
summary = {}
for company in companies:
    last_price = data[company]['Close'][-1]
    first_price = data[company]['Close'][0]
    change = (last_price - first_price) / first_price * 100
    summary[company] = change

# Write the summary and table to a text file
with open('stock_summary.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Stock Trends Summary:\n')
    for company, change in summary.items():
        file.write(f'{company}: {change:.2f}%\n')
    file.write('\nStock Prices Table:\n')
    file.write(table.to_string())

print('Stock summary has been written to stock_summary.txt file.')
```

After running the code, it will create a text file named `stock_summary.txt` that contains the summary of the stock trends and a table of the stock prices for the last 3 months.

Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!

write a paragraph in a TXT file explaining the stock trends and draw insights based on the trends

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engineer (to Admin):

Certainly! Here's an example of how you can write a paragraph in a text file explaining the stock trends and drawing insights based on the trends:

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Define the list of MAANG companies
companies = ['META', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'NFLX', 'GOOGL']

# Fetch the historical stock data for the last 3 months
data = yf.download(companies, period='3mo', group_by='ticker')

# Calculate the stock trends and insights
insights = []
for company in companies:
    last_price = data[company]['Close'][-1]
    first_price = data[company]['Close'][0]
    change = (last_price - first_price) / first_price * 100
    if change > 0:
        trend = 'increased'
    elif change < 0:
        trend = 'decreased'
    else:
        trend = 'remained unchanged'
    insights.append(f"The stock price of {company} has {trend} by {change:.2f}% over the last 3 months.")

# Write the insights to a text file
with open('stock_insights.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Stock Trends and Insights:\n')
    for insight in insights:
        file.write(f'{insight}\n')

print('Stock insights have been written to stock_insights.txt file.')
```

After running the code, it will create a text file named `stock_insights.txt` that contains a paragraph explaining the stock trends and drawing insights based on the trends.
